# Create Collection

Using the [web console](https://console.weavedb.dev/), click `Data Collections` in the side menu, and then click the `+` icon in the `Collection` box to open up a dialog. After putting the name of your collection in the "Collection ID" input field, click "Add".

For this example, we will set `people` as our collection name.
