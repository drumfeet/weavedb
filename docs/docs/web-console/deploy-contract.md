4. Set `Secure` to `False` for the purposes of this tutorial. (Note: In a production setting, you should never set `Secure` to `False`.)

5. Finally, click on `Deploy DB Instance`. Your WeaveDB database will be deployed to the mainnet in just a few seconds. You can view the transaction for the deployment by clicking on the `contractTxId` link.
